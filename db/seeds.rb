# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# User.create(firstname: "Les", lastname: "Test", title: "Web Developer", email: "lgworldcom@gmail.com", password: "password", organization_id: 1)

# Organization.create(name: "LG Media", address: "990 Stewart Avenue", suite: "7th Floor", city: "Garden City", state: "NY", zip: "11530", phone: "516-833-5506", mission: "", website: "https://www.lg-mediagroup.com/", category_id: 1)
